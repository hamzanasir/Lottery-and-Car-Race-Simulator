# Lottery and Car Race Simulator

A simple program that takes infromation from two textfiles regarding participants in a lottery game and the automobile awards to be distributed to the winners. The program then computes the winners (alongside the losers) and also the cheaters (people who tried to cheat the system using fake SSN's or the same SSN for multiple entries). As a final fun bit the program simulates a race between these winners and their new cars by assigning each car a random acceleration and a fixed racing distance. Please note that main file is LotteryAndRaceSimulator.java
